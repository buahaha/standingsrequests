## [0.3.5] - 2019-10-12

### Added

- Standing requests for corporation can now be disabled via setting. Disabling it hugely improves performance and load times of requests pages ([#6](https://gitlab.com/basraah/standingsrequests/issues/6))

- Added Spinners to all pages, that load data asynchronously, which improves user experience

### Changed

- Requests page: Characters and corporations are now loaded asynchronously and a spinner is shown which improves user experience ([#6](https://gitlab.com/basraah/standingsrequests/issues/6))

- Now gives clear feedback if tables are empty, e.g. if they are no requests to manage. Before it was often unclear if a table was empty or still loading.

- Improved installation instructions in README
